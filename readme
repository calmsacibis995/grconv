Grconv converts between almost 100 character sets, transcription,
transliteration methods, and encodings that are used to represent
Greek text in different environments.  For complete documentation
refer to the program's manual page.

To compile grconv edit the Makefile setting the following variables:
CC	The name of your C++ compiler
BINDIR	The installation directory for the program executable
MANDIR	The installation directory for the program manual page

You will need a C++ compiler and the appropriate libraries, Perl,
and the flex(1) lexical analyzer.  The 4 C++ files generated by flex(1) and
the 2 C++ files generated by the Perl script are included in the source
distribution in case flex and/or Perl are not available.  To regenerate
the Windows makefile.msc after changing Makefile you will also need sed(1).

Run "make" to compile the program and "make install" to install the
program and its documentation.  Under Windows run "nmake /f makefile.msc"
to compile the program.

Many thanks to Alexis Zavras, Isidor Kouvelas, Alexandros Chousainov,
and Athanasios Oikonomou who provided valuable input and suggestions.
