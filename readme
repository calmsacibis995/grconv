Grconv converts between a large number of character sets, transcription,
and transliteration methods that are used to represent Greek text.
In addition, it supports a number of encodings used to represent
those character sets in different environments.  For complete documentation
refer to the program's manual page.

To compile grconv edit the Makefile setting the following variables:
CC	The name of your C++ compiler
BINDIR	The installation directory for the program executable
MANDIR	The installation directory for the program manual page

You will need a C++ compiler and the appropriate libraries, and the
flex lexical analyzer.

Run "make" to compile the program and "make install" to install the
program and its documentation.

Many thanks to Alexis Zavras, Isidor Kouvelas, and Alexandros Chousainov
who provided valuable input and suggestions during the program's testing.
