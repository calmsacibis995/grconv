Grconv converts between almost 100 character sets, transcription,
transliteration methods, and encodings that are used to represent
Greek text in different environments.  For complete documentation
refer to the program's manual page.

To compile grconv edit the Makefile setting the following variables:
CC	The name of your C++ compiler
BINDIR	The installation directory for the program executable
MANDIR	The installation directory for the program manual page

You will need a C++ compiler and the appropriate libraries, and the
flex lexical analyzer.

Run "make" to compile the program and "make install" to install the
program and its documentation.  Under Windows run "nmake win32exe"
to compile the program.

Many thanks to Alexis Zavras, Isidor Kouvelas, and Alexandros Chousainov
who provided valuable input and suggestions during the program's testing.
